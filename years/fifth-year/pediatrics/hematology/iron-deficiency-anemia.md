# Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA)

## Definition
A type of anemia characterized by small, pale red blood cells (microcytic, hypochromic) caused by insufficient iron.

## Etiology
- Increased demand (e.g., pregnancy, rapid growth in adolescence)
- Increased loss (e.g., GI bleeding, heavy menstruation)
- Decreased intake or absorption (e.g., vegetarian diet, celiac disease)

## Clinical Features
- Fatigue and weakness
- Pallor (best seen in conjunctiva and palmar creases)
- Pica (craving for non-nutritive substances)
- Koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails) in chronic cases

## Diagnosis
- **CBC:** Low Hb (♂<13 g/dL, ♀<12 g/dL), Low MCV (<80 fL), Low MCH (<27 pg)
- **Iron studies:** 
  - Low serum ferritin (<15 ng/mL) - most specific
  - Low serum iron
  - High TIBC
  - Low transferrin saturation (<15%)

## Management
1. **Oral iron supplementation:**
   - Ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg elemental iron) 1-2 times daily
   - Take on empty stomach with vitamin C to enhance absorption
2. **Identify and treat underlying cause**
3. **Parenteral iron:** For intolerance or malabsorption
4. **Blood transfusion:** Only for severe symptomatic anemia (Hb<7 g/dL)
