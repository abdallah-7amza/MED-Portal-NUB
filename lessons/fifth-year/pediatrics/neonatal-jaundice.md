# Neonatal Jaundice

## Overview
Neonatal jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia) is a common and usually benign condition in newborns, but it is a top cause for concern and hospital readmission. It refers to the yellow discoloration of the skin and sclera due to elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood. The primary challenge is to differentiate benign physiological jaundice from pathological jaundice, which may signal a serious underlying disorder.

## Pathophysiology
Bilirubin is a breakdown product of heme (from red blood cells). This process creates unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin, which is lipid-soluble and neurotoxic. The liver enzyme, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), conjugates bilirubin, making it water-soluble (direct) and allowing it to be excreted in bile and urine.

Newborns are prone to jaundice because:
1.  **Increased Bilirubin Load:** They have a higher red blood cell volume and a shorter RBC lifespan (~90 days vs 120 days).
2.  **Decreased Conjugation:** The UGT enzyme system is immature, especially in preterm infants.
3.  **Increased Enterohepatic Circulation:** The neonatal gut has bacteria that can de-conjugate bilirubin, allowing it to be reabsorbed.

## Differentiating Physiological vs. Pathological Jaundice

### Physiological Jaundice
- **Onset:** Appears *after* 24 hours of life.
- **Peak:** Rises slowly, peaking around day 3-5.
- **Duration:** Usually resolves by 1-2 weeks.
- **Bilirubin Level:** Total serum bilirubin (TSB) typically does not exceed 15 mg/dL.

### Pathological Jaundice
- **Onset:** Appears *within* the first 24 hours of life.
- **Rate of Rise:** TSB rises rapidly (> 5 mg/dL per 24 hours).
- **Level:** TSB is higher than expected for age (e.g., >15 mg/dL).
- **Duration:** Persists for more than 2 weeks.
- **Associated Signs:** Hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, signs of illness.
- **Direct Bilirubin:** Elevated direct (conjugated) bilirubin (>2 mg/dL or >20% of TSB) is always pathological.

## Common Causes of Pathological Jaundice
- **Hemolysis:** ABO/Rh incompatibility, G6PD deficiency, spherocytosis.
- **Sepsis:** Can impair liver function and increase hemolysis.
- **Cephalohematoma:** A large collection of blood under the scalp that breaks down, releasing bilirubin.
- **Breast Milk Jaundice:** A benign condition where substances in breast milk inhibit bilirubin conjugation. It's a diagnosis of exclusion.

## Management
1.  **Screening:** All newborns should be visually inspected for jaundice every 8-12 hours.
2.  **Measurement:** If jaundice is suspected, measure TSB or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB). Plot the value on an age-specific nomogram (e.g., Bhutani nomogram) to assess risk.
3.  **Phototherapy:** The primary treatment. Blue-green light (460-490 nm) converts unconjugated bilirubin into non-toxic, water-soluble isomers that can be excreted without conjugation.
4.  **Exchange Transfusion:** Reserved for dangerously high levels of bilirubin unresponsive to phototherapy. It removes the infant's blood and replaces it with donor blood, directly removing bilirubin and any antibodies causing hemolysis.
